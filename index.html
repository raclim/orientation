					<h2>We ðŸ’œ Open-Source Software</h2>
					<section>
						<p>Processing and p5.js are friendly tools for learning to code and make art.</p>
						<p>They are free and open-source and built by inclusive and nurturing communities. </p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>At our core is the philosophy and politics of FLOSS (Free, Libre, Open Source Software).</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>We see software as a medium and means for creating and problem-solving.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>We believe that learning to program is not only about acquiring a certain skill set, but also about developing a creative and exploratory process.</p>

				<!-- All-Contributor Specification -->
				<section data-background-gradient="linear-gradient(to bottom, #fff, #EDDFFF)">
					<h2>What is a Contributor?</h2>
					<section>
					<p>Open-source projects thrive on an active community of contributors.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Beyond the <a href="https://processingfoundation.org/people">team</a> you will be working with at the Processing Foundation, there are countless contributors who help shape <a href="https://github.com/processing/processing4?tab=readme-ov-file#contributors">Processing</a>, <a href="https://github.com/processing/p5.js?tab=readme-ov-file#contributors">p5.js and the p5.js Editor</a>.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Processing Foundation builds on feminist principles of collaboration and actively works against capitalist assignment of values.</p>
				</section>
					<section>
						<p>From bug-fixing, file-organizing, translating, tutorial-writing to event organizing, we follow the <a href="https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key">All-Contributor Specification</a> and recognize all types of contributions as equally valuable.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>This is because contributors come from all walks of life and contribute in many different ways.</p>
					</section>
				</section>

				<!-- Why Contribute -->
				<section data-background-gradient="linear-gradient(to bottom, #fff, #EDDFFF)">
					<h2>Why Contribute?</h2>
					<section>
						<p>Software contribution is a type of volunteer work. It is a great way to learn new skills, get feedback on your work, and connect with other people in the community.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>In an increasingly algorithmic and platform-driven society, Processing Foundation continues to commit to keeping our software free, open-source, and ad-free.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>But software is expensive to make and we need support!</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>As a non-profit organization, we're able to approach software development through mentorship. Instead of building fast and breaking things, we take the time to build technology with communities.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>We can't wait to work with you!</p>
						<p>By the end of this program, you will be acknowledged as one of the <a href="https://github.com/processing/processing4?tab=readme-ov-file#contributors">Processing</a> or <a href="https://github.com/processing/p5.js?tab=readme-ov-file#contributors">p5.js</a> contributors!</p>
