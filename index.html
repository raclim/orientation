					<h2>We ðŸ’œ Open-Source Software</h2>
					<p>At our core is the philosophy and politics of FLOSS (Free, Libre, Open Source Software). We see software as a medium, and a means for thinking and making. We believe that learning to program is not only about acquiring a certain skill set, but also about developing a creative and exploratory process. We believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be free and accessible to everyone.</p>
