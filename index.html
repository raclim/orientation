					<h2>We ðŸ’œ Open-Source Software</h2>
					<p>At our core is the philosophy and politics of FLOSS (Free, Libre, Open Source Software). We see software as a medium, and a means for thinking and making. We believe that learning to program is not only about acquiring a certain skill set, but also about developing a creative and exploratory process. We believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be free and accessible to everyone.</p>

					<h2>What is a Contributor?</h2>
					<p>Open-source projects thrive on an active community of contributors. Beyond the <a href="https://processingfoundation.org/people">team</a> you will be working with at the Processing Foundation, there are countless contributors who help shape <a href="https://github.com/processing/processing4?tab=readme-ov-file#contributors">Processing</a>, <a href="https://github.com/processing/p5.js?tab=readme-ov-file#contributors">p5.js and the p5.js Editor</a>.</p>

						<h3>What Counts as a Contribution?</h3>
						<p>Processing Foundation builds on feminist principles of collaboration and actively works against capitalist assignment of values. From bug-fixing, file-organizing, translating, tutorial-writing to event organizing, we follow the <a href="https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key">All-Contributor Specification</a> and recognize all types of contributions as equally valuable.</p>
